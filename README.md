This is just for internal project use. If anyone not working with me in this project is viewing this, then you gonna have to wonder for sometime. But nevertheless, this is meant to be in overlay workspace for an RTAB project for Clearpath Robotics Jackal J100, on top of RTABMap offered by IntroLab. If you want to use this file then, create workspace and clone the RTABMap package from IntroLab. Then, Under rtabmap_demos/launch create a directory called jackal and paste these files there, And also Colcon build. I suggest to do it with Symlink. Good Luck
